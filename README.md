# about-me-game
A project to create a website-like game offering fun facts about me


## Lab: 03 - Extend your 'About Me' and guessing game
## Project Name: about-me-game

- I build a guessing game that let users know more fun information about me. The user is required to answer 7 questions about me, where each correct answer is granted with 5 points score.
- After completing the game, read more information about me from my webpage.

- Have fun!

**Reflections and Comments**
- I added two more questions to the guessing game, so the total is seven questions.
- Each correct answer is granted 5 points score, so the best score for this game is 35 points.
